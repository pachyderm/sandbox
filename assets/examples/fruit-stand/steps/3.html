Now take a look at the transform JSON. Here we specify how we want to process the data. In our case, we want to perform 2 steps.

</p>
<p>

The first is a filter. We want to separate out each type of fruit that we care about. This is a type of transform that is easy to parallelize. The default mode of a transform is a 'map'. This means that each node running this transform sees a chunk of the file.

The second is a sum. This is a reduce step. Each node needs to guarantee that it sees the entire file so that it can aggregate any results.
